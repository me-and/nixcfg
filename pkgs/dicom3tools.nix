# I'd originally planned to make this available in nixpkgs, but per the below
# links, the person responsible for the project is deeply reluctant for some of
# the binaries to be distributed if they're not compiled with the user's own
# allocated UID.  Some of the binaries are clearly safe, and the key ones I
# cared about for converting DICOM images to formats ImageMagick can work with
# are ones I'd have thought were safe, but those aren't distributed in the
# maintainer's binaries for Windows or Mac, and (unlike some binaries) don't
# compile to byte-identical executables when compiled with different UIDs.
#
# Maybe I could work out a way to do it safely, and/or just do what Debian did
# and only provide binaries that don't include the ones I've been interested
# in, but neither of those are very satisfying.  For now this package lives in
# my local repository for the rare occasions I want it and for reference for
# anyone who manages to stumble across it.
